# FlashcardGUI

Flashcard app, created in Python with Tkinter, to aid language learning by displaying words and, upon button click, their translations. It reads data from a CSV file and allows users to add new word pairs. It is meant as a simple tool for vocabulary learning.

The code was written in Python 3.10.0 and the package versions are stored in ```requirements.txt```. The code can be run by calling ```quickstart.py```.

* ```quickstart.py``` - file to run
* ```flashcardUI.py``` - class that handles the main GUI logic
* ```flashcard.py``` - class that handles the styling and logic of a single flashcard
* ```window.py``` - general specifications for window formatting (size, color etc)
* ```vocabulary.csv``` - document to store the vocabulary to show on the flashcards

The implementation is still in progress.
