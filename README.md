# FlashcardGUI

The code was written in Python 3.10.0 and the package versions are stored in ```requirements.txt```. The code can be run by calling ```quickstart.py```.

* ```quickstart.py``` - file to run
* ```flashcardUI.py``` - class that handles the main GUI logic
* ```flashcard.py``` - class that handles the styling and logic of a single flashcard
* ```window.py``` - general specifications for window formatting (size, color etc)
* ```vocabulary.csv``` - document to store the vocabulary to show on the flashcards

The implementation is still in progress.
